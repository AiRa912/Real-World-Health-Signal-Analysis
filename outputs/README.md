## Problem:
### What are the most commonly reported side effects for top drugs, and how do sentiments about these drugs vary over time?

## Answer:
#### ðŸ§ª Top 5 Reported Side Effects per Top 10 Drugs
A heatmap analysis of top-reported side effects by drug revealed clear and recurring patterns:

Hormonal contraceptives like Levonorgestrel, Norethindrone, Etonogestrel, Nexplanon, and Norgestimate frequently showed high mentions of: Tics, acne, pain, and mood swings.

Notably, Levonorgestrel had the highest mention count for tics (3,470) and acne (1,509).

SSRIs such as Escitalopram and Sertraline were commonly associated with:Anxiety, depression, and stress.

Escitalopram in particular had over 1,300 mentions of anxiety and 775 for depression.

Phentermine, a weight loss medication, had distinct side effects including: Dry mouth, stress, and tics.

Mirena, an intrauterine device, was frequently linked to:Pain and nausea.

Naltrexone, used in addiction management, had lower frequencies overall, but notable mentions of anxiety and nausea.

ðŸ“Œ These trends suggest that hormonal treatments often show high prevalence of dermatological and neurological side effects (e.g., acne, tics), while psychiatric medications center more around mood-related conditions.

#### ðŸ“ˆ Sentiment Trends Over Time for Top 10 Drugs
An analysis of sentiment scores over time revealed distinct emotional trajectories for the most discussed medications:

Phentermine maintained a consistently positive sentiment across the timeline, often peaking well above other drugs. This suggests enduring user satisfaction, potentially linked to its effectiveness in weight management.

Naltrexone showed fluctuating but generally positive sentiment, indicating varied but hopeful experiencesâ€”consistent with its use in addiction recovery, where results and emotional responses can be deeply personal.

Escitalopram and Sertraline, both SSRIs, consistently trended in the negative sentiment range. This steady pattern may reflect persistent struggles with side effects or unmet expectations in mental health treatments.

Hormonal contraceptives like Norethindrone, Etonogestrel, Nexplanon, and Levonorgestrel hovered around neutral sentiment, with minor dips and rises, suggesting a mix of positive and negative experiences.

Mirena and Norgestimate remained relatively stable with near-neutral sentiment, hinting at less emotionally charged feedback or a balanced mix of pros and cons reported by users.

ðŸ“Œ This time-series analysis underlines how psychiatric and hormonal drugs often invoke steady, emotionally weighted responses, while lifestyle and addiction-related treatments can produce more positively charged and varied sentiment arcs over time.

#### ðŸ“Š Average Sentiment Score for Top Drugs
A bar chart of average compound sentiment scores across top drugs showcased clear sentiment polarities:

Phentermine emerged as the most positively reviewed drug with a sentiment score over +0.3, pointing to high satisfactionâ€”likely due to visible, fast-acting results in weight management.

Naltrexone followed with a strongly positive score (~ +0.16), reflecting favorable user experiences in addiction treatment contexts.

Mirena, Etonogestrel, and Levonorgestrel scored near-neutral to slightly positive, suggesting mixed but balanced public perception, commonly associated with hormonal contraceptives.

Escitalopram and Sertraline, both SSRIs, had notably negative average sentiment scores, with Sertraline receiving the lowest (~ -0.12). These results align with common reports of emotional side effects or dissatisfaction with outcomes.

Hormonal treatments like Norethindrone, Nexplanon, and Norgestimate also leaned negative, though to a lesser extent, hinting at recurrent side effects or inconsistent user satisfaction.

ðŸ“Œ This snapshot suggests that psychiatric and hormonal medications generally draw more critical sentiment, while drugs targeting weight loss or addiction recovery elicit greater approval, likely due to visible impact and perceived effectiveness.
